0x14. C - Bit manipulation

In this project, I learnt how to manipulate bits and use the bitwise operators >>, <<, &, |, and ^ in C.

Header file
main.h file = Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

Requirements
General

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line.
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables.
No more than 5 functions per file.
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded

Tasks
0. 0
mandatory
Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars
Return: the converted number, or 0 if
there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1
b is NULL

1. 1
mandatory
Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);
Format: see example
You are not allowed to use arrays
You are not allowed to use malloc
You are not allowed to use the % or / operators

3. 11
mandatory
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred

4. 100
mandatory
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred

5. 101
mandatory
Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);
You are not allowed to use the % or / operators

6. Endianness

100-get_endianness.c: C function that checks the endianness.
If big-endian - returns 0.
If little-endian - returns 1.

7. Crackme3

101-password: File containing the password for the crackme3 executable.
